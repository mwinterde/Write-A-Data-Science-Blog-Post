# Installation
In order to run the code a simple Anaconda distribution of Python will be enough. 
If you are not using Anaconda you need to install the following packages using pip:
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* geopandas
* sklearn

# Project Motivation
As a business graduate I have always been interested in the relationship between the value of a product or service and its price. 
In this analysis I explore different value drivers of Airbnb apartments and examine their impact on price. 

Among others, I will give answers to the following questions in the course of this analysis:

1. In which neighbourhoods do hosts charge the highest prices?
2. Is there a relationship between the number of listings per neighbourhood an its average price?
3. What are common amenities that hosts provide?
4. Is there a relationship between the number of amenities provided and price?
5. Do the reservation terms of a listing impact its price?
6. Do hosts give personal or volume discounts?
7. What types of costs can users expect in addition to regular prices?

# File Descriptions
* `AirbnbBerlin.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook which contains the full analysis including documentation and interpretation
* `/data/listings.csv.gz` - a dataset with information of 25,164 Airbnb listings from Berlin
* `/data/neighbourhoods.csv` - an additional dataset that maps neighbourhoods to neighbourhoods groups
* `/data/neighbourhoods.geojson` - an additional dataset with geospatial information on neighbourhoods

# Results
Please take a look in the notebook to see the results.
